I am Xueying Liu, currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (VT), under the supervision of Professor [Xinwei Deng](https://xwdeng80.github.io/). I am also a member of VT Statistics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([VT-SAIL](https://www.sail.stat.vt.edu/)).

My research focuses on developing advanced statistical and machine learning methods tailored to complex, real-world applications through collaborations with various disciplines. Specifically, my study covers the following topics:

* Multi-task learning for clinical trial data (Bristol Myers Squibb)
* Statistics-guided continual learning for AI tasks (AI Center of Excellence, Deloitte)
* Statistical and network modeling with application to social and behavioral science ([Biocomplexity Institute at University of Virginia](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/))
* Modeling complex data and uncertainty quantification

# Education
* Ph.D. in Statistics, Virginia Tech, 2020-Present
* M.S. in Statistics, Georgia Tech, 2018-2020
* B.S. in Mathematics, Shanghai University, China 2014-2018

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
