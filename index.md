I am Xueying Liu, currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech (VT), under the supervision of Professor [Xinwei Deng](https://xwdeng80.github.io/). I am also a member of VT Statistics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([VT-SAIL](https://www.sail.stat.vt.edu/)).

My research focuses on developing advanced statistical and machine learning methods tailored to complex, real-world applications through collaborations with various disciplines. Specifically, my study covers the following topics:

* Multi-task learning for clinical trial data (Bristol Myers Squibb)
* Statistics-guided continual learning for AI tasks (AI Center of Excellence, Deloitte)
* Statistical and network modeling with application to social and behavioral science ([Biocomplexity Institute at University of Virginia](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/))
* Modeling complex data and uncertainty quantification

# Education
* Ph.D. in Statistics, Virginia Tech, 2020-Present
* M.S. in Statistics, Georgia Tech, 2018-2020
* B.S. in Mathematics, Shanghai University, China 2014-2018
